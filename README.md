# Pseudocode
A plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or in a program. This is always programming language agnostic. Just plain English, basically. It acts as a language bridge between logic and the actual code.

## Importance
Pseudocode is crucial for planning the steps and logic in an algorithm or program. It is also very important for collaborating with others as it is a great medium for you to communicate your ideas about the project.

## Characteristics
- Plain language: simple and understandable.
- Structured: demonstrates a clear logical sequence
- Abstracted: focuses on logic over specific syntax or language specific jargon.
- Detailed: thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic.

## Basic Construct:

- Sequential 
```
	Step 1: Do this
	Step 2: Do this
```

- Conditional
```
	IF condition matches THEN
		Do something
	ELSE 
		Do something
	END IF
```

- Loop
```
	WHILE condition meets 
		Do something
	END WHILE
```

```
	FOR EACH item in collection
		Do something
	END FOR
```

## Practical Examples

- Example 1: Calculating the sum of a list of numbers
```
	Initialise sum to 0
	FOR each number in the list
		ADD the number to sum
	END for 
	Print sum
```
